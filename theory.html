            <h4>Are the following statements sensible/correct? Briefly motivate your answer.</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>The mean is strongly affected by extreme values.</strong></dt>
                <dd>True. The mean is given by (x1 + . . . + xn)/n so it always changes with the change of any value xi.</dd>

                <dt><strong>In systematic sampling, we simply use results that are very easy to get.</strong></dt>
                <dd>False. Results that are very easy to get are used in convenience sampling.</dd>

                <dt><strong>A bar chart can be used to visualize data at the ratio level of measurement.</strong></dt>
                <dd>False. Bar chart can be used only for qualitative data, at the nominal or ordinal level of measurement.</dd>

                <dt><strong>Download speeds (in MB/s) are at the interval level of measurement.</strong></dt>
                <dd>False. Download speeds are at the ratio level of measurement, since there is a natural zero starting point.</dd>

                <dt><strong>According to the “68–95–99.7” rule, about 95% of the data points in a sample
                    originating from a normal distribution will fall within 3 standard deviations of the
                    population mean.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Incorrect. About 95% of the data points in a sample originating from a normal distribution will fall within 2 standard deviations of the population mean.</dd>

                <dt><strong>The sample mean and the sample mode are always equal for data at the ordinal
                    level of measurement.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Incorrect. The sample mean cannot be computed for ordinal data.</dd>

                <dt><strong>The sample standard deviation cannot be computed if the sample size n equals 1.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Correct. In the formula for sample standard deviation we divide by n − 1, so for n = 1 the sample standard deviation cannot be computed.</dd>

                <dt><strong>The probability of a union of two events is always less than or equal to the sum of
                    the probabilities of these two events.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Correct. P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B) and P(A∩B) is nonnegative, so P(A∪B) ≤ P(A) + P(B).</dd>
