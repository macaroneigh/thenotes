            <h3>Executives of a news portal investigate the amount of time its visitors spend on the
                main page of the portal. Time spent by 25 randomly chosen visitors was measured and
                the results of these measurements are presented below:</h3>

                    domly selected visitor will spend more than 30 seconds on the main page of the
                    portal.</strong></dt>
                <dd>In the table of measurements, 13 of them exceed 30 seconds.<br>
                    Therefore, an estimate based on the relative frequency is 13/25 = 0.52.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h4>The executives would like the population distribution of the amount of time spent on
                the main page to be normally distributed with mean μ = 30.00 seconds and standard
                deviation σ = 10.00 seconds.</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Give, assuming that the goal of the executives is achieved, the probability that a
                    randomly selected visitor will spend less than 28 seconds on the main page of the

                <dd>The amount of time spent on the main page is assumed to be normally distributed with mean

                    Therefore, the z-score of 28 seconds is: (28.00 - 30.00) / 10.00 = -0.20. <br>
                    We use Table 2 and see that P(Z ≤ -0.20) = 0.4207 or 42.07%, where Z denotes the standard normal distribution. <br>
                    Hence, the probability that a single randomly selected visitor will spend less than 28 seconds on the main page of the portal is 0.4207 (or 42.07%).</dd>

                <dd>The mean amount of time spent on the main page by n = 36 randomly selected visitors is
                    normally distributed with mean μ = 30.00 and standard deviation σ = 10.00 / √36 = 5/3, by the
                    Central Limit Theorem. <br>
                    Therefore, the z-score of 28 seconds is (28.00 - 30.00) / (5/3) = -1.20. <br> 
                    We use Table 2 again and see that P (Z ≤ −1.20) = 0.1151. <br>

                from previous experience that the probabilities that Android, iPhone, and Windows
                Phone users will pay the additional fee to get rid of ads are 10%, 60% and 20% respec-

                <dd>We first need to find the probability P(Windows) that a randomly selected user has a Windows phone. <br>
                    Note that P(Windows) = 1 − P(Android) − P(iPhone) = 1 − 0.2 − 0.65 = 0.15. <br>
                    Since the app is popular, we follow the small sample rule, i.e., we treat selections as independent events. <br>
                    Therefore, by the multiplication rule for independent events we get: <br>
                    P(two randomly selected users have a Windows phone) = P(Windows) * P(Windows) = 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.0225 </dd>

                <dt><strong>Compute the probability that a randomly chosen user paid the additional fee.</strong></dt>

                    = 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.6 * 0.65 + 0.2 * 0.15 <br>
                    = 0.02 + 0.39 + 0.03 = 0.44.</dd>

                <dd>We are intersted in P(iPhone|fee). By definition of conditional probability: <br>
                P(iPhone|fee) = P(iPhone & fee)/P(fee) <br> 
                Using the multiplication rule in the numerator (and the answer from part b) in the denominator we get: <br> 
                P(iPhone|fee) = (P(fee|iPhone) * P(iPhone)) / P(fee) <br>
                = (0.6 * 0.65) / 0.44

            <h3>Every employee of a big company received recently a new laptop. All laptops come
                with a pre-installed operating system, including, among others, a highly unstable web
                browser Verge. It turns out that the probability of Verge crashing at least once while
                surfing the Internet equals 0.80. Since Verge has such bad reputation, many users choose
                to replace it with a more stable web browser called Marble. Some time after the intro-
                duction of the new laptops the IT department of the company surveyed its employees
                about the user experience. It turns out that 92% of employees who experienced at
                least one crash of Verge installed Marble, and 46% of employees who did not have any
                problems with Verge decided to switch to Marble anyway.</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Compute the probability that a randomly chosen employee has Marble installed
                    on their laptop.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Recall that A = {Verge crashed at least once} and B = {Marble is installed}. <br> 
                    We have P(A) = 0.80, and P(not A) = 1 − P(A) = 0.20, where "not A" is the complement of the event A. <br> 
                    We also have P(B|A) = 0.92 and P(B|not A) = 0.46. <br> <br>
                    By the law of total probability: <br>
                    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) * P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.92 · 0.80 + 0.46 · 0.20 = 0.828.</dd>

                    probabilities in percentages.)</strong></dt>
                <dd>We are interested in P(A|B). <br>
                    By Bayes’ theorem: <br> <br>
                    P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)) <br> <br>
                    Therefore: <br> <br>
                    P(A|B) = (0.92 * 0.80) / (0.92 * 0.80 + 0.46 * 0.20) <br>
                    = (2 * 4 * 0.46 * 0.20) / (2 * 4 * 0.46 * 0.20 + 0.46 * 0.20) <br>
                    = 8 / 9 <br> 
                    = (approx.) 0.889</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Do crashes of Verge increase the probability of installing Marbles? Does it imply
                    that the events A = {Verge crashed at least once} and B = {Marble is installed}

                <dd>Crashes of Verge increase the probability of installing Marbles, since P(B|A) = 0.920 > 0.828 = P(B).<br>
                    It also implies that A and B are dependent, because if they were independent, P(B|A) = P(B).</dd>

                    Similarly, B = {HTT,THT,TTH}, so P(B) = 3/8. <br> 
                    Finally, A ∩ B = {THT} and P(A ∩ B) = 1/8. <br>
                    However, P(A) * P(B) = 1/2 * 3/8 = 3/16 =/= 1/8 = P (A ∩ B). <br>
