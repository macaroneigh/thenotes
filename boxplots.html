            <h3>Figure 1 shows a histogram, a boxplot, and a normal QQ-plot of a sample x.</h3>

            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Describe briefly what the boxplot tells you about the location, spread and shape
                    of the underlying data.</strong></dt>
                <dd>From the boxplot we can infer that the data has a median around −1. The 0.25-quantile of the sample is around −1.2 and the 0.75-quantile is around −0.6. Therefore, the interquartile range is approximately −0.6 − (−1.2) = 0.6, which describes the spread of the data. The boxplot indicates that the data is symmetric, with three outliers on the left-hand side.</dd>

                <dt><strong>What does the area of a bar in the histogram represent?</strong></dt>
                <dd>The area of a bar in the histogram is equal to the relative frequency of the data in the interval below the bar.</dd>

                <dt><strong>What can you deduce form the QQ-plot with respect to the tails of the underlying
                    distribution of the data compared to the tails of a normal distribution?</strong></dt>
                <dd>When we draw a (imaginary) straight line through the middle of the QQ plot, we see that the left part of the plot is below this straight line. Therefore, the left tail of the underlying distribution of the data is heavier than that of a normal distribution.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Figure 1 shows histograms of Sample A and Sample B, a boxplot of Sample B, and
                three normal QQ-plots. It is known that Samples A and B originate from two different
                population distributions.</h3>
            <img src="images/boxplot_02.png" style="height: auto; width: 75%;">
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>By looking at both histograms, what can be said about the tails of the population
                    distribution of Sample A with respect to the tails of the population distribution of
                    Sample B?</strong></dt>
                <dd>The histogram of Sample A resembles the bell-shaped curve. On the other hand, the other histogram indicates that Sample B comes from a population distribution that concentrates a lot of mass in the center (and looks quite uniform). Therefore, both tails of the population distribution of Sample A will be heavier than both tails of the population distribution of Sample B.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>What does the box (i.e., the three lines: top and bottom sides of the box and the
                    thick line in the middle) in a boxplot represent?</strong></dt>
                <dd>The bottom line is the first quartile, the middle line is the second quartile (in other words, the median), and the top line is the third quartile.</dd>

                <dt><strong>Two out of the three normal QQ-plots correspond to Sample A and Sample B.
                    Indicate which QQ-plot depicts Sample A and which one depicts Sample B, and
                    motivate your answer.</strong></dt>
                <dd>Sample A – normal QQ-plot 2, Sample B – normal QQ-plot 1. Both samples seem quite symmet- ric, and this automatically rules out the third normal QQ-plot. Sample A seems quite normal, and Sample B has lighter tails than normal distribution.</dd>
