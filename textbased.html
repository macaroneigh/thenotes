            <h4>Sealed Classes</h4>
            <h5>Which of the following statements about sealed classes are true?</h5>
            A sealed class must be final. <br>
            <strong>Sealed classes allow for exhaustive pattern matching without a default case.</strong> <br>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <h5>Which of the following statements are true? (Select 0 or more)</h5>
            An abstract class must be final. <br>
            <strong>A class that contains 1 or more abstract methods must itself be abstract.</strong> <br>
            Abstract classes cannot be inherited from. <br>
            <strong>A non-abstract subclass must provide an implementation for abstract methods in the superclass.</strong> <br>
            Abstract methods must return abstract types. <br>
            <strong>An abstract class cannot be instantiated.</strong>
            <!---->
            <h4>Traits</h4>
